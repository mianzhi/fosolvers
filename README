FOSolverS, a suite of free and open source solvers, is a scientific computation
project created with the following design goals:

  1. The product should be able to solve practical engineering problems. (It is
  likely to be more useful than your CFD course project from grad-school.)
  
  2. The product should be easy to hack. (There are not many fluid dynamics
  expert who are also experienced C++ architect.)


Currently the project consists of three major components:

  libfosolvers: unstructured grid data structures and procedures, grid and data
  IO, interface to algebraic solvers, FVM and FEM spatial schemes, condition
  management framework, UDF management framework.
  
  fopbc: a general-purpose, compressible, "all-Mach-range" fluid solver. The
  solver employs a pressure-based-coupled method which solves the pressure and
  momentum equations simultaneously, and solves the energy equation in a
  segregated way.
  
  foeuler: a general-purpose, compressible Euler equation (invisid flow) solver.
  The solver uses first-order Roe's scheme for spatial discretization, and
  BDF-Newton-Krylov method for temporal stepping.
